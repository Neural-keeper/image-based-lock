# image-based-lock
This is a project that attempts to add an element of fun and unpredictability to the traditional password. As of creation, it tries to identify the number of human faces in an inputted image. If the number of faces natches the set password, it will allow access into the program. 

Current bugs:
- The model being used is unreliable in discerning the number of faces

Based on this, it is likely that the type of lock will be revised in the future.
